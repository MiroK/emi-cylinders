A sheet (structured grid) of cardiac cells can be viewed as a collection
of tiles. Not every tile needs to be made from scratch. In fact about 4
pieces form the basis of tiles; with the other ones obtained as shifts and
rotations of the basis. The basic pieces are

1) corner piece = left and bottom edge neighbor exterior
2) bottom piece = bottom edge neighbors exterior
3) left piece = left edge neighbors exterior
4) center piece = no edge neighbors exterior
